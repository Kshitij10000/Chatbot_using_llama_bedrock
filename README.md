## Introduction

This project is a simple yet powerful chatbot application leveraging the Llama3 or any other Llama models language model and AWS Bedrock. The chatbot can handle various natural language processing tasks and provide intelligent responses.

## Features

- Conversational AI using Llama3
- Scalable deployment using AWS Bedrock
- RESTful API interface for easy integration
- Secure and efficient communication

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- AWS account with necessary permissions
- AWS CLI configured with your AWS credentials
- Docker installed on your local machine
- Python 3.12

## Architecture

The architecture of this chatbot application includes the following components:

1. **Llama3 Model**: The core language model for the chatbot.
2. **AWS Bedrock**: Service for managing and scaling the Llama3 model.
3. **API Gateway**: Exposes RESTful API endpoints for interaction with the chatbot.
4. **Lambda Functions**: Backend functions to process API requests and interact with the Llama3 model.
5. **DynamoDB**: For storing conversation history and user data.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the chatbot:

Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/chatbot-llama3-aws-bedrock.git
   cd chatbot-llama3-aws-bedrock

Set up virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure AWS CLI:

aws configure
Deploy AWS resources using CloudFormation or Terraform:

Ensure you have the necessary deployment scripts in place (CloudFormation templates or Terraform configuration).
Build and deploy Docker container:

docker build -t chatbot-llama3 .
docker run -p 8000:8000 chatbot-llama3
Usage
To interact with the chatbot, you can use the provided API endpoints. Here is an example using curl:

curl -X POST "https://your-api-endpoint.amazonaws.com/prod/chat" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello, chatbot!"}'
You can also integrate the API into your web or mobile application.
